GPU Volume Raycasting and Transfer Functions Generation

This is a GPU ray-casting renderer with various features, including transfer functions, peeling, and importance driven rendering. We implemented our approach with OpenGL and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) on a personal computer equipped with an AMD Athlon 7750 Dual-Core processor, 4GB memory and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 240 graphics card. Experiments are conducted on several common datasets that are publicly available on the Volume Library. The original datasets in PVM format are converted into RAW format with the PVM tools distributed with the V^3 (Versatile Volume Viewer) volume rendering package.

## Examples

BenBen's Story

You might interest in an autobiographic story by Ben (an author of this project). The story is regarded as a unique satire fable which reflects the people in a some kind of advanced institute (as it is claimed to be) located in a remote village that is somehow in a mess of utilitarianism which urge them to concern with matters of consequences that one never knows if it is actually important or not and important to what if it is important. [Here is the story](../../wiki/Story).
